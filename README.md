# residual_feature_extraction
A pipeline that carries out feature extraction of residual substructure within the residual images produced by popular galaxy structural-fitting routines such as GALFIT, GIM2D, etc. This pipeline works on model-subtracted residual images by popular structural fitting routines (e.g., GALFIT, GIM2D, etc) to extract faint low surface brightness features by isolating flux-wise and area-wise significant contiguous pixels regions by rigourous masking routine. This routine accepts the image cubes (original image, model image, residual image) and generates several data products
